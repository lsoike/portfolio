  <h1>LAYNE SOIKE</h1>
  <h3>Graphic Designer</h3>

<p>A little about me. I was born and raised in Seattle, so the PNW will always be home. I have a passion for the outdoors – backpacking in the mountains as well as being out on the water, cooking – the kitchen is my happy place, and of course design – which led to me to a profession as a graphic designer.</p>
 
<p>After graduating from the University of Washington, I started my career at Boeing. It was here that I was able to take advantage of continuing my education and completed an online degree in design while working full-time. I was then hired on as part of the global brand team where I have now supported sales and marketing on a variety of print, digital and branding projects for the past seven years. I’ve also established my own freelance business and have helped a diverse set of clients.</p>
 
<p>Currently, I am back at UW pursuing a Masters of Science in Human Centered Design and Engineering (a mouthful, right?). The program focuses on usability, human-computer interaction and user experience design. With design being such a fast growing industry, I'm looking forward to the possibilities this field of study will open for me.</p>
