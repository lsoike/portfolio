    In this assignment you will create 2 p5.js visually interesting programs. They should do something new, creative, 
    and interesting. The goal is for your programs to not be too complex, but rather explore with different aspects of p5.js. You might 
    explore more with sound, or keyboard and mouse input, or maybe you might explore with text and images or even video.
